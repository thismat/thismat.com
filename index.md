My name is Matt, and I'm simply just this Matt, not that Matt, or even THE Matt.

This is a home for my continued education and exploration into software development, technology, and other hobbies I fall in and out of.

It will probably remain quite informal, as this is really just a personal space for me to keep track of my progress and put pressure on myself to continue learning and growing.

>*I personally believe even though our field is full of temporary solutions that we can directly (though maybe unsung) impact the quality of life of those who use our software...and I want that impact to be positive instead of negative.*
